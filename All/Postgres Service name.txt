[foyez@localhost ~]$ pgrep -u postgres -fa -- -D
So pgrep will look at processes and will try to grep on it. Here is the options I added to make it look as I wanted:
-u postgres will only look at processes owned by the user postgres
-f will look at the pattern in the whole command line, not only the process name
-a will display the whole command line instead of only the process number
-- will allow a pattern that begins by - (like our -D)

[foyez@localhost ~]$ pgrep -u postgres -fa -- -D
1287 /usr/pgsql-14/bin/postmaster -D /var/lib/pgsql/14/data/



[foyez@localhost ~]$ systemctl list-unit-files | grep postgres
postgres_exporter.service                     enabled
postgresql-14.service                         enabled


[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status postgresql-14
